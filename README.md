Concepts I've learned/used during this project:

Pseudo-elements ::before and ::after.   

Common page elements such as buttons, spans, forms...

The  attr() function is used in the home page's horizontal navigator bar. 

Variables (--variables)

Flexbox, inline, inline-block, and block display elements 

Absolute vs relative vs fixed vs sticky position of elements

Margin-collapsing
