Concepts I've learned how to use during this project:

Pseudo-elements ::before and ::after. It created the text in the home page's horizontal navigation bar.  

I gained a deeper understanding of the list elements, and flexbox in CSS. 

The  attr() function is used in the home page's horizontal navigator bar. 

Absolute vs relative vs fixed position of elements.
