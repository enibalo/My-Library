Concepts I've learned during this project:

Pseudo-elements before and after used to create the text int the horizontal navigator bar. 

Gained a deeper understanding of the list elements, and flex box in CSS. 

The content propeorty, which is used by thorizontal navigator bar, it contains the text dispayed by the element. 

The attr() function which gets the contents of an attribute of an element.
